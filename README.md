# LangChain-for-LLM-Application-Development
Repo for LangChain course. Gain hands-on experience in enhancing language models (LLMs) for application development, covering topics like Models, Prompts, and Parsers, Memories for LLMs, Chains, Question Answering over Documents, and Agents.

#### Course Content

The course contains following topics:

- **Models, Prompts, and Parsers:** Calling LLMs, providing prompts, and parsing the response.
- **Memories for LLMs:** Storing conversations and managing limited context space.
- **Chains:** Creating sequences of operations.
- **Question Answering over Documents:** Applying LLMs to proprietary data and use case requirements.
- **Agents:** Exploring the emerging development of LLMs as reasoning agents.

By the end of the course, we can have a developed model that serves as a starting point for further exploration of diffusion models for our applications.

#### LangChain Libraries' Main Value Propositions

1. **Components:**
   - Composable tools and integrations for working with language models.
   - Modular and easy-to-use, compatible with the LangChain framework or standalone.

2. **Off-the-shelf Chains:**
   - Built-in assemblages of components for higher-level tasks.
   - Facilitate easy customization of existing chains and building new ones.

#### Components Modules

- **Model I/O:**
  - Prompt management, prompt optimization, a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.

- **Retrieval:**
  - Data Augmented Generation involving specific chain types interacting with external data sources for data retrieval. Examples include summarization of text and question/answering over specific data sources.

- **Agents:**
  - LLMs making decisions about actions, standard interfaces for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end-to-end agents.

#### LangChain Framework

The LangChain framework enables applications that:
- **Are context-aware:** Connect language models to context sources.
- **Reason:** Rely on language models for reasoning.

The framework comprises several components:

1. **LangChain Libraries:**
   - Python and JavaScript libraries containing interfaces and integrations for various components, a basic runtime for combining components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations.

2. **LangChain Templates:**
   - Easily deployable reference architectures for a variety of tasks.

3. **LangServe:**
   - A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API.

4. **LangSmith:**
   - A developer platform for debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring chains built on any LLM framework, seamlessly integrating with LangChain.
